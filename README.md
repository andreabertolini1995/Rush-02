# Rush-02
A C implementation of a program that takes a number as argument and converts it to its written letters value.

The program can take up to 2 arguments:
- If there is only one argument, it is the value to be converted.
- If there is two arguments, the first argument is the new reference dictionary and the second argument is the value to be converted. 
If the argument is not a valid positive integer, the program will return an error message.

The code can be compiled by just typng *make* on the command line.
